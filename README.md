# Fuel Consumption Comparison with Streamlit

[[This project]](https://github.com/fabio1623/technical_challenge_DA) compares the consumption of two fuels (E10 and SP98) based on various parameters, such as distance, speed, temperature, weather, and whether or not the AC is on. The project includes a Jupyter notebook for data cleaning and preparation, as well as a Streamlit application for displaying the results and comparing algorithms for regression and classification models.

You can see a running instance [here](https://gas-eda-fabio1623.streamlit.app).

Please note that it is deployed on Streamlit Cloud so the application could go in sleep mode and need some time to reload.
